The following requirements apply to your use of all Ciptadana services:

You will not use any electronic communication feature of a Ciptadana service for any purpose that is unlawful, tortious, abusive, intrusive on another's privacy, harassing, libelous, defamatory, embarrassing, obscene, threatening or hateful.
You will not upload, post, reproduce or distribute any information, software or other material protected by copyright or any other intellectual property right (as well as rights of publicity and privacy) without first obtaining the permission of the owner of such rights.
You will not collect or store personal data about other users.

MARKET INFORMATION
We may make available to you through one or more Ciptadana services a broad range of financial information that we obtain from third party service providers. This includes financial market data, quotes, news, analyst opinions, and research reports. Collectively, we refer to this as "Market Information." Ciptadana does not endorse or approve Market Information, and we make it available to you only as a service and convenience. Ciptadana and our third party service providers do not (1) guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, completeness or correct sequencing of Market Information, or (2) warrant any results from your use or reliance on Market Information. Market Information may quickly become unreliable for various reasons including, for example, changes in market conditions or economic circumstances. Neither Ciptadana nor the third party service providers are obligated to update any information or opinions contained in any Market Information, and we may discontinue offering Market Information at any time without notice. You agree that neither Ciptadana nor the third party service providers will be liable to you in any way for the termination, interruption, delay, or inaccuracy of any Market Information. You will not redistribute or facilitate the redistribution of Market Information, nor will you provide access to Market Information to anyone who is not authorized by Ciptadana to receive Market Information. If you are a securities broker, dealer, banker, or investment advisor, you agree not to use Market Information provided by Ciptadana for any purpose related to your business.

NO INVESTMENT ADVICE OR RECOMMENDATIONS
Ciptadana services and content (including Market Information) are for information, education, and entertainment purposes only. Although Ciptadana services may provide information relating to investment approaches and opportunities to buy or sell securities, you should not construe any Market Information, features, tools or other content available through any Ciptadana service as legal, tax, investment, financial or other advice. Nothing contained in any Ciptadana service or any other content on our web site constitutes a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer by Ciptadana or a third party service providers to buy or sell any securities or other financial instruments.

You alone assume the sole responsibility of evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of any Ciptadana service before making any decisions based on Market Information or content contained in a Ciptadana service. In exchange for using Ciptadana services, you agree not to hold Ciptadana or any third party service providers liable for any possible claim for damages arising from any decision you make based on information made available to you through any Ciptadana service.

USE OF ACCESS DEVICES
With the exception of applications commonly known as web browser software, or other applications formally promoted, endorsed or approved by Ciptadana in writing, you agree not to use any software, program, application or any other device to access or log on to any Ciptadana service, including Ciptadana's computer systems, Web site or proprietary software or to automate the process of obtaining, downloading, transferring or transmitting any Market Information or any other content to or from any Ciptadana service, including Ciptadana's computer systems, web site or proprietary software.

DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS
Ciptadana and/or its employees or directors as well as its affiliates, consultants and third party service providers may have clients with positions in securities or companies referenced in Market Information and may, as principal or agent, buy from or sell to customers.
